# Employee Tracker Content Management System

## Description

This is a CLI app that shows employees, roles, and departments from a database. These items can also be updated by the user.

This project helped me hone my node skills as well as my implementation of mySQL. I felt the actual SQL code was pretty straightforward, but I got really hung up on how to convert IDs <--> Names in a way I could use them.

I created this Employee Tracker based on the following acceptance critiera:

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including _employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to_

WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
```
